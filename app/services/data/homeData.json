    "info": "I am constantly growing as a web developer. Backend or frontend? Preferably both! But my passion is definitely frontend. I work well in groups and always keep my code clean and simple. While working on projects, I always try to learn something new. I have almost one-year professional experience working with JavaScript, React, TypeScript, Git. I am also very familiar with the concept of the REST API. Privately, I love British football, Tarantino movies, Breaking Bad and Dire Straits :)"

There I actively participate in the development of the UI KIT, by creating components and unit tests, releasing the new versions, and respond to customer problems on the forum (similar to Stack Overflow). For some time I also take part in creating projects for clients, not connected with the UI KIT. Currently, I combine work with part-time studies at Warsaw University of Technology (Computer Science).",
